This is just a sample implementation of Dependency Injection that shouldn't be used
in real projects as it's just a learning material and does not contain a lot of the
stuff that real dependency injection needs.

This project contains a sample entry point file `app.php`.

## Defining services

All definitions are via annotations (which I don't advise to use in real implementations).

Annotate the service with `Rikudou\DI\Annotations\Service` and it's done.

## Project documentation

As this is just a learning material, all code is documented via comments.
